  <h1> Lyrics </h1>
  <div id="lyrics" class="containers lyrics">
    <p> We go together
      Better than birds of a feather, you and me
      We change the weather, yeah
      I'm feeling heat in December when you're 'round me
      I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars.
      I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
      You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
      And, baby, you know its obvious </p>
    <p>  I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
      No one knows about you (about you) about you (about you)
      And you're making the typical me break my typical rules
      It's true. I'm a sucker for you, yeah
      Don't complicatie (yeah)
      'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
      I can't remember (yeah) </p>
    <p>  All of the nights I don't remember
      When you're 'round me (oh, yeah yeah)
      I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars.
      I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
      You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
      And, baby, you know its obvious </p>
    <p>  I'm a sucker for you
      You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly.
      I'm a sucker for you, yeah
      Any road you take, you know that you'll find me.
      I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
      No one knows about you (about you) about you (about you)
      And you're making the typical me break my typical rules
      It's true. I'm a sucker for you, yeah
      I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
      No one knows about you (about you) about you (about you)
      And you're making the typical me break my typical rules
      It's true. I'm a sucker for you, yeah </p>
